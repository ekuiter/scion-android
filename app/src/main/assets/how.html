<h2 style="margin-top: 20px">How to use</h2>
<p>To connect to the SCIONLab network using this app, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol style="margin-bottom: 20px">
    <li>Register for a free user account on <a href="https://www.scionlab.org/">scionlab.org</a>.</li>
    <li>
        In &quot;<a href="https://www.scionlab.org/user/">My ASes</a>&quot;, create a new SCIONLab AS with the following settings:
        <ul>
            <li><em>Label</em>: Enter any value, ignored by this app</li>
            <li><em>Installation type</em>: Choose <strong>SCION installation from sources</strong></li>
            <li><em>Attachment point</em>: Choose any attachment point you like, preferably the nearest to your location</li>
            <li><em>Use VPN</em>: You <strong>must</strong> check this box</li>
            <li><em>Public Port</em>: You <strong>must not</strong> change this from its default value 50000</li>
        </ul>
        Alternatively, you can also use an existing SCIONLab AS if you adjust its settings as described above.
        In that case, also make sure that the <em>Active</em> box is checked.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you have created the AS, you can download its configuration from &quot;My ASes&quot; as a <em>.tar.gz</em> archive.
        Store this archive somewhere on your smartphone (e.g., on the SD card).
    </li>
    <li>
        In the app, press the blue SCION button (labelled with "Start").
        The app will ask you to install <em>OpenVPN for Android</em>, which is required to connect to SCIONLab.
        <em>You do not need to start OpenVPN for Android manually, everything is set up by the SCION app.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        Once <em>OpenVPN for Android</em> is installed, press the SCION button again.
        You may have to grant permissions regarding VPN and media storage.
        Then choose the <em>.tar.gz</em> SCIONLab configuration you have downloaded previously.un
    </li>
    <li>
        The app will now connect to SCIONLab and ping the given SCION address.
        To disconnect, press the SCION button again.
        To ping a different SCION address, enter it in the text field and press the apply button (labelled with âœ“).
    </li>
</ol>
